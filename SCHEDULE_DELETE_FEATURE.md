# Doctor Schedule Deletion Feature

## Overview
This feature allows hospital administrators to delete doctor schedules from the system. This is useful when schedules need to be completely reset or when there are major changes required.

## Backend Implementation

### New API Endpoint
- **DELETE** `/api/doctors/:doctorId/schedule`
- **Authorization**: Hospital Admin only
- **Description**: Deletes the current approved schedule for a specific doctor

### Controller Function
- `deleteDoctorSchedule` in `backend/controllers/doctorController.js`
- Validates admin permissions
- Checks if doctor belongs to the same hospital
- Clears the doctor's current schedule
- Sends notification to the doctor
- Returns confirmation with deleted schedule data

### Security Features
- Role-based access control (hospital_admin only)
- Hospital boundary validation (admin can only delete schedules of doctors in their hospital)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit logging through notifications

## Frontend Implementation

### Enhanced Components
- **DoctorScheduleManagement.js**: Added delete functionality with confirmation dialog
- **Delete Button**: Appears only when a current schedule exists
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Shows warning and doctor information before deletion

### User Experience Features
- Visual confirmation dialog with warning messages
- Loading states during deletion process
- Success/error notifications
- Automatic refresh of schedule data after deletion

## Usage Instructions

### For Hospital Administrators:
1. Navigate to Doctor Management â†’ Schedule Management
2. Select a doctor from the dropdown
3. If the doctor has a current approved schedule, a delete button (trash icon) will appear
4. Click the delete button to open the confirmation dialog
5. Review the warning and doctor information
6. Click "Delete Schedule" to confirm the action

### What Happens When a Schedule is Deleted:
1. The doctor's current schedule is completely removed
2. The doctor receives a notification about the deletion
3. The doctor will need to submit a new schedule request
4. Any future appointments based on the deleted schedule may need to be rescheduled

## API Response Examples

### Success Response
```json
{
  "message": "Doctor schedule deleted successfully",
  "deletedSchedule": [
    {
      "day": "Monday",
      "startTime": "09:00",
      "endTime": "17:00",
      "maxPatients": 10,
      "slotDuration": 30,
      "isActive": true
    }
  ],
  "doctor": {
    "_id": "doctorId",
    "name": "Dr. John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@hospital.com"
  }
}
```

### Error Responses
- **403**: Access denied (not hospital admin or doctor not in same hospital)
- **404**: Doctor not found or no doctor record
- **400**: No current schedule found to delete

## Security Considerations
- Only hospital administrators can delete schedules
- Administrators can only delete schedules of doctors in their own hospital
- All deletions are logged and the doctor is notified
- The action is irreversible (no soft delete)

## Future Enhancements
- Add schedule backup before deletion
- Implement soft delete with restore capability
- Add bulk schedule deletion for multiple doctors
- Add schedule deletion history/audit trail
