   - Assigns patient to hospital if new patient
   - Creates/updates PatientAssignment record
   - Links patient to assigned doctor
   - Sends notifications to patient
   - Saves all changes to database

2. **Patient Assignment Logic:**
   - Creates PatientAssignment with assigned doctor
   - Updates existing assignments if patient already exists
   - Links primary doctor to patient
   - Maintains active status for assignments

handleAppointmentStatusUpdate(appointmentId, newStatus, doctorId)
```
